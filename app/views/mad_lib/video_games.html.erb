I, the <%= @adjective %> and <%= @adjective_2 %>
<%= @first_name %> has <%= @past_tense_verb %>
<%= @first_name_2 %>'s <%= @adjective_3 %>
sister and plans to steal her <%= @adjective_4 %>
<%= @plural_noun %>! What are a <%= @animal %> and backpacking <%= @animal_2 %> to do?
Before you can help <%= @name %>, you'll have to collect the <%= @adjective_5 %>
<%= @plural_noun_2 %> and <%= @adjective_6 %>
<%= @plural_noun_3 %> that open up the
<%= @number %> worlds connected to
<%= @first_name %> lair. There are
<%= @number_2 %> <%= @plural_noun_4 %> and
<%= @number_3 %> <%= @plural_noun_5 %> in the
game, along with hundreds of other goodies for you to find.
