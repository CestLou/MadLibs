Girls in Space

What if you lived on the International Space Station? Imagine your normal day as it is now, but in space!

In the morning, you get up at TIME and get dressed in your space <%= @clothing_plural %> and space <%= @clothing_singular %>. There is no gravity in space, so you float into the kitchen to eat your breakfast of dried <%= @food_plural %>, <%= @food_singular %> in a tube, and smashed up <%= @food_singular_2 %> in a plastic space container. Then, instead of taking the bus to school, you hop into <%= @vehicle %> and orbit Earth <%= @number %> times.

In the vehicle,you do adjective science experiments such as determining how good <%= @animal %> is at <%= @verb %>ing in space. When the experiments are done, you go outside the <%= @vehicle %> for some <%= @exercise %> in space. You <%= @verb %> outside the <%= @vehicle %> for an hour or more. When you are done <%= @exercise %>ing, you go back to the International Space Station for other activities such as <%= @verb_2 %>ing, <%= @verb_3 %>ing, and <%= @verb_4 %>ing.

You end the day by sending a(n) <%= @noun %> to your parents via the space computer, and they tell you goodnight from Earth, down below.
